  `All Green Hills Academy learners and staff members, together, form
a tight-knit community, with individuals advising and helping one
another. It’s not a rare sight to find learners conversing with
educators, and other school staff during break or lunch. It is
also vibrant, with a variety of personalities and nationalities
represented, and a number of activities to choose from.`,
  `  Has your opinion ever been challenged? Welcome to the Theory of
Knowledge class, which is part of the International Baccalaureate
program. With a wide variety of individuals and opinions, one
must adapt and be open-minded to new opinions. Your views and
beliefs are constantly attacked, which teaches you to defend them
and become reflective of your own and other’s opinions. Through
various courses learners are able to use their learning to solve
real-life experiences, preparing them to steadily integrate into
the community once they graduate.`,
  `  The Green Hills Academy meals are generally large and satisfying.
The welcoming kitchen staff offers a vegetarian option, therefore
all learners are catered for. We have breaks and lunch, daily,
except for Wednesday and Friday, where lessons go up to half day.
Break consists of cookies, cake, or mandazi, an African delicacy,
with a cup of tea and juice. Lunch offers diverse platters
including spaghetti bolognese, accompanied by legumes and fruits.
`,
  `  Extracurricular activities include sports, cooking, music, Model
United Nations and debate. Sports not only enhance competition and
teamwork, it also aid learners in dealing with the daily stress of
school assignments. The school band performs annually across
Rwanda allows learners to nurture their performance skills.
Model United Nations and debate allows learners to intelligently
and eloquently, argue and defend their perspectives. The two
extracurricular activities produce international-minded
individuals ready to discuss global issues.`,
